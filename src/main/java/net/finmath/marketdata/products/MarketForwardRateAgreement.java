/**
 * Implements the valuation of a market forward rate agreement using curves
 * (discount curve, forward curve).
 *
 * The value of the forward rate agreement at its maturity time <i>t</i> is
 * <br>
 * <i>
 * (F(t)-K) / (1 + F(t) * dcf(periodStart,periodEnd))
 * </i>
 * where <i>F(t)</i> is the forward evaluated at maturity and
 * dcf(periodStart,periodEnd) is a given paymentOffset.
 *
 * The value of the forward rate agreement returned for an earlier time is
 * the above payoff multiplied with the corresponding discount factor curve.
 * Note that this valuation ignores a possible convexity adjustment between
 * the forward and the discount factors since the above formula is not a
 * linear function of <i>F</i>. Put differently, if this product is used
 * to calibrate a forward curve to a forward rate agreement, then the
 * calibrated forward curve will include the convexity adjustment.
