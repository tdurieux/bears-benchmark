 * Random number generators for samples of uniform distributed random variables and generators and transformation for other distriburtions.

 * Classes in this package provide wrappers for random number generators from thirs party libraries (e.g. Mersenne-Twister from commons-math),
 * native implementation of quasi random number gerantors (e.g. Halton sequence) and algorithm to sample other distributions
 * (like the Acceptance-Rejection method).
