/**
 * This class provides the library wide conversion from a floating point number to a LocalDate.
 *
 * While in practical applications a date or time should always be represented with a proper
 * date class, e.g. <code>LocalDate</code>. In financial applications the measurement
 * of time distances has to be based on a solid definition, e.g., daycount conventions to calculate
 * daycount fractions.
 *
 * However, many mathematical models described in text books rely on time being model as some
 * real value \( t \).
 *
 * To allow for both approaches to co-exists this class fixes the interpretation of a floating
 * point number representing time, <i>unless otherwise specified</i>.
 *
 * So it still possible that models use their own "conversion".
 *
 * Examples where the specification of this contract is important:
 * - the way of measuring time in an NSS curve determines the interpretation of the NSS parameters.
 * - in the textbook Black-Scholes models, multiplying volatility by W(t), changing from an ACT/365 to ACT/360 would represent a re-scaling of the volatilities.
