# Coding Conventions

We follow losely the Eclipse coding conventions, which are a minimal modification of the original Java coding conventions. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Coding_Conventions

We deviate in some places:

-   We allow for long code lines. Some coding conventions limit the length of a line to something like 80 characters (like FORTRAN did in the 70'ies). Given widescreen monitors we believe that line wrapping makes code much harder to read than code with long(er) lines.

-   We usually do not make a space after statements like `íf`, `for`. We interpret `íf` and `for` as functions and for functions and methods we do not have a space between the name and the argument list either. That is, we write

    if(condition) {
      // code
    }

The project is using a checkstyle profile, which currently only a very limited set 
of style issues. See [finmath-checkstyle.xml](https://github.com/finmath/finmath-lib/blob/master/finmath-checkstyle.xml).
