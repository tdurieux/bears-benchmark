****************************************

**Mathematical Finance Library: Algorithms and methodologies related to mathematical finance.**

****************************************

The finmath lib libraries provides (JVM) implementations of methodologies related to mathematical finance, but applicable to other fields. Examples are

- General numerical algorithms like
    - Generation of random numbers
    - Optimization (a Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is provided)
- Valuation using **Fourier transforms** / **characteristic functions**
	- Black-Scholes model
	- Heston model
	- Bates model
	- Two factor Bates model
- **Finite difference methods**
	- Numerical schemes using finite differences
		- Theta-scheme
	- Models
		- Black-Scholes model
	- Products
		- European option
- **Monte-Carlo simulation** of multi-dimensional, multi-factor stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
    - LIBOR Market Model
    - Black-Scholes type multi-asset model (multi-factor, multi-dimensional geometric Brownian motion)
    - Equity Hybrid LIBOR Market Model
    - Hull-White Short Rate Model (with time dependent parameters)
    - Merton Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
    - Heston Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
- **American Monte-Carlo**: Estimation of conditional expectations in a Monte-Carlo framework
- **Stochastic Automatic Differentiation** (AAD) (part of the package `net.finmath.montecarlo.automaticdifferentiation`)
- **Monte-Carlo Simulation on GPGPUs** (via Cuda) (requires finmath-lib-cuda-extensions https://github.com/finmath/finmath-lib-cuda-extensions )
- Dependency injection on numerical algorithms (Monte-Carlo simulations) with custom return type priorities (see http://ssrn.com/abstract=3246127 ).
- **Calibration** of market data objects like curves (discount and forward curve) or volatility surfaces
	- **Multi-curve interest rate curve calibration** (OIS discounting, basis-swaps, cross-currency-swaps).
	- **Bond curve calibration** using local linear regression (see https://ssrn.com/abstract=3073942 ).
    - Various interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, harmonic spline, Akima).
    - Various interpolation entities (value, log-value, rate, etc.).
    - Parametric curves like Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel-Svensson.
- Simulation of interest rate term structure models (LIBOR market model with local and stochastic volatility)
- Calibration of the **LIBOR market model**
- Valuation of complex derivatives
    - Bermudan options / multi-callables lower bound via regression estimation of the conditional expectation
    - Bermudan options / multi-callables upper bound via dual method
- Hedge Simulation
- Margin Valuation Adjustments (MVA) though forward ISDA SIMM simulation (this is currently a separate project at https://github.com/finmath ).

Languages and Build
--------------------------------------

The library is available for Java 8 and Java 6. We are starting to provide examples in Kotlin.

The Maven build file is provide. Import the project as Maven project.

The default Maven profile is Java 8 without Kotlin. To enable Java 6 version select the Maven profile 'java-6'. To enable Kotlin select the Maven profile 'kotlin'.

Distribution
--------------------------------------

finmath lib is distributed through the central maven repository. It's coordinates are:

For the Java 6 version:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
	<classifier>java6</classifier>

For the Java 8 version:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
	
You may build the Java 8 version via Maven using

	mvn -P java-8

and the Java 6 version using

	mvn -P java-6
	
Source code
-------------------------------------

The finmath lib Java library comes in two flavors which have a slightly different code base: a Java 8/9 version and a Java 6 version.
We will use Java 8 and Java 9 concepts in the future and try to provide Java 6 compatibility where possible.

For that reason, the source code is duplicated:
-    src/main/java				contains the Java 8 compatible source files
-    src/main/java6				contains the Java 6 compatible source files

Although the two folder share some/many identical source files, we prefer this two folder layout
over one with a third folder like java-common.


### Building finmath lib

-    To build finmath lib for Java 8 use src/main/java
-    To build finmath lib for java 6 use src/main/java-6

These builds may be performed via Maven the profiles "java-8" and "java-6".
The eclipse project file is pre-configured to Java 8.

#### Maven build

The maven pom defaults to the Java 8 build. To build finmath lib for Java 6 use the maven profile "java-6".

Extensions
-------------------------------------

The finmath-lib-cuda-extensions implement the RandomVariableInterface via Cuda GPU code. This allows to perform Monte-Carlo simulations on the GPUs with a minimal change: a replacement of the random variable factory.

The finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions implement the RandomVariableInterface via an AAD enabled version. This allows to access automatic differentiations with a minimal change: a replacement of the random variable factory.
Starting with version 3.3.1 the finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions is part of finmath-lib.

Coding Conventions
-------------------------------------

We follow losely the Eclipse coding conventions, which are a minimal modification of the original Java coding conventions. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Coding_Conventions

We deviate in some places. See [[codingconventions]] for details.
